1. What is artificial intelligence?

 No standard definition of AI 
among those working in the field

  AI has even been defined as:

“… the collection of problems and methodologies
studied by artificial intelligence researchers."
- Luger and StubbleField



9

Other Definitions
Machines that think like humans
 The exciting new effort to make computers think… machines with minds, in the full and 

literal sense (Haugeland, 1985)
 The automation of activities that we associate with human thinking, activities such as 

decision-making, problem solving, learning… (Bellmann 1978)

Machines that act like humans
 The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when 

performed by people (Kurzweil, 1990)
 The study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are 

better. (Rich and Knight, 1991)

Machines that think intelligently
 The study of mental faculties through the use of computational models (Charniak and 

McDermott, 1985)
 The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act 

(Winston, 1992)

Machines that act intelligently
 A field of study that seeks to explain and emulate intelligent behavior in terms in 

terms of computational processes (Schalkoff, 1990)
 The branch of computer science that is concerned with the automation of intelligent 

behavior (Luger & Stubblefield, 1993)



10

Approaches to AI: 
Engineering VS Cognitive Approach 

 Engineering Approach: 
 Tries to find optimal solutions
 No matter how (not necessarily what human do)

 Cognitive Approach:
 Tries to understand the process
 Tries to reproduce human behavior (even if wrong result)

 4 points of view: Systems that can…

Cognitive 
approach

Engineering / Rational 
approach

Behavior act like humans act intelligently
Reasoning think like humans think intelligently



11

Approaches to AI: Weak VS Strong AI
 Weak AI :

 A system whose capabilities are not intended to 
match or exceed the capabilities of human beings.
 A system can demonstrate intelligence, but does not 

necessarily have a mind, mental states or consciousness. 
 Usually, a small application with a single purpose

 Strong AI: 
 typically used in science fiction
 A system that matches or exceeds human intelligence. 
 A system that could have: consciousness, self-awareness, the 

ability to feel sentiments,  …
 Usually, a “general purpose” application capable of several 

tasks

13

What is Intelligence, Anyways?
 are you intelligent if you:

 can do complex arithmetic quickly?
 humans are bad at it
 … but computers are good at it

 can recognize a face in a picture?
 humans are good at it
 … but hard to automate in a computer

 hold a 15 min. conversation? 
 humans are good at it
 … but really hard to automate in a computer



14

What is Intelligence?
 intellectual vs physical capabilities

 a dog has a more acute sense of smell…
 a bat can see at night…

 reflex vs planned/reasoned action
 when the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first 

deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside, and only 
then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. 

 but that's instinctual behavior
 if the food is moved a few inches away while she is inside: on 

emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food 
is displaced. 

 awareness of existence (consciousness of itself) 
 if a system passes a test for intelligence but is not aware of it, 

is it intelligent?  
 but the only way to really know if a machine is thinking is to be 

the machine…

Is Deep Blue Intelligent?
 In 1996 and 1997 IBM's Deep Blue beat the 

human chess champion Kasparov in a 
six-games match. 

 But Deep Blue uses:
 plain brute force technique 
 on a massively parallel supercomputer
 can explore 200,000,000 positions per second (Kasparov can 

examine 3/sec)  
 Today, emphasis on more intelligent chess programs
 in Nov. 2006, Deep Fritz vs. Kramnik, ran on an ordinary  

Intel Core 2 Duo CPUs

16

Is Chess Playing Intelligent?

“Chess is far easier than innumerable tasks performed by an 
infant, such as understanding a simple story, recognizing 
objects and their relationships, understanding speech, and so 
forth. For these and nearly all realistic AI problems, the 
brute force methods in Deep Blue are hopelessly inadequate.” 

– David Stork



17

Is Watson Intelligent?

 In 2011, IBM’s Watson competed on 
Jeopardy!

 Watson beat Brad Rutter, the biggest all-time money 
winner on Jeopardy!, and Ken Jennings, the record 
holder for the longest championship streak 

 Watson received the first prize of $1 million
 Watson is a question answering system... "an application 

of advanced Natural Language Processing, Information 
Retrieval, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, and 
Machine Learning technologies to the field of open 
domain question answering”

Today
 Important questions

1. What is artificial intelligence?
2. What is intelligence?
3. Is there a test for intelligence?

 What do we do in AI?
 History of AI
 An example: Eliza



20

A Test for Intelligence…
 The Turing Test

 The “imitation game”
 Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950
 If a human interrogator cannot tell the 

computer and human apart, then the computer 
is intelligent

 Measures the intelligence of a computer vs. a 
human

 Turing predicted that by 2000, a machine 
might have a 30% chance of fooling a person 
for 5 minutes



21

The Turing Test

 A human mediates between the interrogator and 
the machine



22

The Turing Test

 Some capabilities required to pass the 
Turing test:
 Natural Language Processing (NLP) to 

communicate
 Knowledge Representation to store knowledge
 Automated Reasoning  to infer new knowledge
 Machine Learning
 …



23

Arguments For the Turing Test

 Objective notion of intelligence
 Prevents us from arguments about the 

computer’s consciousness
 Eliminates bias in favor of humans
 …



24

Arguments Against Turing Test

 Not reproducible
 Not constructive 
 Machine intelligence designed w.r.t. humans

 test is anthropomorphic. It only tests if the subject 
resembles a human being. 

 unnecessarily restrict machines
 ex: x-ray vision, fast computations

25

Did anyone pass the Turing Test yet?
 The Long Bets Foundation has $20,000 bet between

 Mitchell Kapor, founder of Lotus Development,  and 
 Ray Kurzweil, inventor
 Kapor bets that "By 2029 no computer - or "machine 

intelligence" - will have passed the Turing Test. “

 After more than 60 year ... <drum roll please> ... In 2014, the 
news reported that a chatbot passed the Turing Test! 

 But, Kurzweil himself is not convinced... because the 
test had restrictions... 

 the chatbot claimed to be a 13-year-old, and 
 one for whom English is not a first language



26

Current Turing Test
CAPTCHA: 

 Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers 
and Humans Apart 

 the system asks a user to complete a test which the 
computer is able to generate and grade, but not able to 
solve. 

 Because computers are unable to solve the CAPTCHA, any 
user entering a correct solution is presumed to be human.

 also known as reverse Turing test, because it is:
 given by a machine and targeted to a human
 in contrast to the Turing test that is given by a human and 

targeted to a machine.

Successes of AI…
 A few years ago, all these were considered AI 

problems… now, no one thinks of them as AI
 OCR – Optical Character Recognition
 Speech Recognition
 Information Retrieval
 Spell checker and Grammar checker
 Expert Systems
 Data Mining
 Word Prediction
 …



33

Some Successes of AI…
 A more  pragmatic definition of AI today : 

"AI research is that which computing scientists do not know how 
to do cost-effectively today.” 





What do we do in AI?

History of AI







Unrealistic Predictions



43

Example of a Toy-World
 toy-world = micro-word
 1973: Winograd developed SHRDLU to understand 

English sentences in a restricted world and carried 
out instructions typed in English with a robot arm.



46

History of AI
 Reality hits (late 60s - early 70s)

 1966: the ALPAC report kills work in machine translation (and 
NLP in general)

 People realized that scaling up from micro-worlds (toy-
worlds) to reality is not just a manner of faster machines and 
larger memories… 

 Minsky & Papert’s paper on the limits of perceptrons (cannot 
learn just any function…) kills work in neural networks 

 in 1971, the British government stops funding research in AI 
due to no significant results

 it’s the first major AI Winter…

 What do we do in AI?
 History of AI
 An example: Eliza



55

Eliza

 Developed by Joseph Weizenbaum 
 In the 1960’s 
 Simulation of a dialogue with a psychologist 
 Great success at the time

 Led at least one psychologist to seriously suggest 
that computers might help alleviate the shortage of 
trained psychotherapists (!)

 Weizenbaum later questioned his own work and 
became one of the field’s biggest critics

GOF
AI



56

Eliza is...

 An example of a simple production system
(see later for a discussion of this type of systems)

 Example dialogs with our new 
psychotherapist...



57

Session with Eliza
 I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time you 

are finished talking, type RET twice.
 I am very unhappy these days
 Are you unhappy often?
 Always after the new classes start
 Tell me about your classes.
 I am registered for artificial intelligence
 Why do you say you are registered for artificial intelligence?
 I feel I should understand more about AI
 Earlier you said you felt unhappy?
 I am unhappy because of the examinations
 Are you sure that is the real reason?
 Not really
 Maybe the examinations have something to do with this.
 This could be one of the reasons
 Is it because of your plans that you say this could be one of the reasons?



59

How does Eliza work?

 See Weizenbaum’s paper at:
 http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/331/papers/eliza.html

“Input sentences are analyzed on the basis of 
decomposition rules which are triggered by key 
words appearing in the input text. Responses are 
generated by reassembly rules associated with 
selected decomposition rules.”

http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/331/papers/eliza.html


60

Algorithm
1. Identify Keywords:

1. Scan the input sentence to look for words in a dictionary of keywords. 
2. Keywords are given a rank, and the highest ranking keyword is considered 

first
2. Get Decomposition Patterns

1. For each keyword, there is an associated list of decomposition patterns  
2. The first decomposition pattern that matches the input sentence is 

selected. 
3. If the decomposition rule does not match, then the next best ranking 

keyword is selected (and go back to step 2.1). 
3. Apply Reassembly Pattern

1. For each decomposition rule, there is a set of associated reassembly 
patterns to generate a response.

2. If a subsequent sentence selects the same decomposition pattern, the 
next reassembly pattern is used (so the output is not repetitive)

4. If there is no keywords in the input sentence, then generate a canned 
response



61

Example
 If the input sentence is: 

 I am very unhappy these days.
 Eliza's response will be: 

 How long have you been very unhappy these days?

 Keyword: 
 I am

 Decomposition pattern: 
 I am <whatever>

 Reassembly Pattern: 
 How long have you been <whatever>?



62

A More Complex Example
  Input sentence:

"It seems that you hate me".

  Keywords: "you" and "me“ 
  Decomposition pattern: 

 <whatever1> you <whatever2> me
 It seems that you hate me

 Reassembly pattern
 What makes you think I hate you?

notice the pronoun 
(me from the user --> you for Eliza)

notice the pronoun 
(you from the user --> I for Eliza)
