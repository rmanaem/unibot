COMP 6721 Applied Artiﬁcial Intelligence (Winter 2022) Worksheet #6: Introduction to Deep Learning Autoencoder. Assume that the 3 × 3 matrix below represents a gray scale image: 0.2 0.3 0.2 X = 0.4 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.9 0.5 Your job is to use X to train an autoencoder. So, the input to our network is going to be X. But what is the expected output (labels)? Deﬁne the size of the input layer: and output layer: of your autoencoder. How many hidden neurons would you use? (Assuming we use a single hidden layer): (Hint: there is no single correct answer, but you can deﬁne a sensible range.) Autoencoder Activation. Assume that we use an autoencoder with the following hyperparameters: the activation function is sigmoid and the hidden layer has a size of 5. Perform a single forward pass through the autoencoder. You can assume an input value of 1 for the biases, and all the weights (including the biases) are initialized to 0.5. Note, our input vector corresponding to the image above is X = [0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.9, 0.5] 1. First, compute the pre-activation function (the net ), by multiplying the input and weights, plus the bias. Rather than listing every weight as on the previous worksheet, we now use matrix notation:1 A = X · W T + b (1) ih ih the result is a matrix of size (1 × 5), A = [ ] 2. Now to compute the result for h, the sigmoid function σ(x) = 1 is applied to the pre-activation 1+e−x result (eq. 1): h = σ(A) = σ(X · W T + b ) (2) ih ih where h is a matrix of size (1 × 5), h = [ ] 3. To compute the output O, the result of the hidden layer (eq. 2) should be multiplied with the weights of the output layer, W , then we apply sigmoid again: ho O = σ(W · hT + b ) (3) ho ho where O is a matrix of size (1 × 9), O = [ ] 1See https://medium.com/from-the-scratch/deep-learning-deep-guide-for-all-your-matrix-dimensions-and-calculations-415012de1568 for a review of matrix calculations for neural networks BreakPage COMP 6721 Worksheet: Introduction to Deep Learning Winter 2022 CNN Activation Map. Assume the following matrix that represents an image. This image will be fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN). Assume that we use the following convolution ﬁlter with a stride of 2 (no padding): What will be the size of the activation map? What will be the activation map? Pooling Layer. What will be the output of the pooling layer with a size of 2 × 2 and a stride of 1, on the activation map of the question above, if we use the following strategies: 1. Average pooling: 2.
