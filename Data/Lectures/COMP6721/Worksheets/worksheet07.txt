COMP 6721 Applied Artiﬁcial Intelligence (Winter 2022) Worksheet #7: Knowledge Graphs & Intelligent Agents, Part I Your ﬁrst Knowledge Graph. We start by modeling some university-related knowledge in form of a graph: (1) Joe studies at Concordia University; (2) Joe knows Jane; (3) Jane studies at McGill University. Draw the graph: Graph Updates. Let’s add some additional knowledge: (4) Joe’s email address is joe@example.com; (5) Concordia is located in Montreal; (6) McGill is located in Montreal. Add these to the graph above. Triples. Graphs can be represented as triples (and vice versa), consisting of <subject> <predicate> <object> Write the triples corresponding to the ﬁrst three statements above: 1. 2. 3. More Triples. Here’s another triple: (Joe, is a, Person). Add it to the graph you drew in the ﬁrst task. BreakPage COMP 6721 Worksheet: Knowledge Graphs & Intelligent Agents, Part I Winter 2022 (cid:207) DBpedia. So far, we deﬁned everything in terms of natural language. That’s not very useful for a knowledge base to be used in an intelligent system. Rather than writing “Concordia”, we will use a URL that points to a machine-readable description in the RDF (Resource Description Framework) format. Using your phone or laptop, look up (our) Concordia University in the open knowledge base DBpedia (http://dbpedia.org):1 • URL: Using URIs. Ok, now let’s go back to the graph from the ﬁrst task. Replace the string “Concordia” with the URL you obtained in the previous step in your graph above. Note: To obtain a complete RDF graph, you’d have to continue replacing all subjects, predicates and objects (except literals) with URLs. More URIs. What about our Joe and Jane? Unlike some famous persons, we will most likely not ﬁnd them in DBpedia (or any other public knowledge graph). However, an organization might have them in their own graph (for example, in Facebook, LinkedIn, or Concordia’s student database). For this example, we simply name them as http://example.org/joe#me (likewise for Jane). How do we model the predicate that Joe knows Jane in a machine-readable way? We will discuss the details in the next lecture; for now, simply use the URI http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows. Re-write the triple (2) from the ﬁrst task using three URIs: • Observe how an intelligent agent can now learn more about each part of this triple simply by resolving the URI and reading the RDF data retrieved through it. Namespaces. Writing these full URIs (technically IRIs) is tiring (and uses up storage space). Using the following preﬁxes: PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> PREFIX user: <http://example.org/> re-write the triple from the previous task, this time with namespaces: • (cid:207) Enriching Graphs. DBpedia contains (among other information) the information which city Concordia is located in. Find the information and write it in form of a triple: • Now add this triple to the graph from the ﬁrst task. AI Agent. Given the knowledge graph you constructed above, can an intelligent agent answer the question “Which city is Joe studying in?”? If yes, how (explain using your graph)? If no, why not (what is missing)? 1What you see in your browser is actually a human-readable web page obtained through a 303 redirect (from /resource/... to /page/...), not the raw RDF data that would be consumed by a program (/data/...).
