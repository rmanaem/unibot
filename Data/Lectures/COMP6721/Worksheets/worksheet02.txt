Worksheet #2: Adversarial Search

Game of Nim. Play a game of Nim against your team mate, starting with 7 tokens (write down the number of
tokens at each move).

MiniMax. Let’s apply the MiniMax algorithm discussed in the lecture on an example (fixed ply depth of 3):

• Find the back-up heuristic values of all non-leaf (internal) nodes using the MiniMax procedure.

• Highlight the best next move for MAX (starting from the root node).

MiniMax Heuristic for Tic-Tac-Toe. Using the heuristic shown below, compute the values of e(n) for the three
game states (MAX plays X):

Two-ply MiniMax. Compute the missing values using MiniMax in the game tree shown below (same heuristic as
above, start node is MAX). What will be MAX’s next move?

Alpha-Beta Pruning. Apply the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm:

on the following search tree:

Step 1: Perform the Alpha-Beta procedure (left-to-right) until you reached the node marked with “Step 1”. Circle
each node that you explored and show which subtrees are cut off by the algorithm (if any).

Step 2: Now continue with the algorithm until you reached the node marked “Step 2”, marking explored nodes and
cut subtrees as before.

Step 3: Complete the algorithm until you calculated the value for the root node in the same fashion.

How many nodes did the algorithm explore (out of 27 possible): ?
