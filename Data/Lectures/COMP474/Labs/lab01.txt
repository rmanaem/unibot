Lab Session #01

Introduction
Welcome to the COMP474/6741 lab sessions! The goal of these labs is to:

learn how to apply the material from the lectures in practice; and 

discuss the course project with your team mates and the TA (as well as demo the results).

Most of the examples provided in the lecture assume you run Linux. But generally, the material covered in the course works cross-

platform (Linux, Mac, Windows).

Task #1: Python
The first task is to become acquainted with Python, in case you haven't worked with it before. There is a separate intro Lab #00, as well

as a "mini-assignment" practice exercise you have to submit. 

Task #2: Hello, Eliza! 
In the lecture you've seen Eliza, which is probably the oldest example of a chatbot/intelligent agent:

Find some version of Eliza and try it out: There are many implementations you can run online or offline, like this one or this one (note

that not all versions you will find use the original DOCTOR script);

Make sure you understand how Eliza works;

Here's a simplified version of Eliza implemented in Python. Clone the GitHub repo so that you can modify and run it locally. Add

"Concordia" as a new keyword, together with some suitable decomposition & reassembly rules and try it out, so you can have a

conversation similar to this: 

  is:~/eliza-master> python eliza.py 

  How do you do.  Please tell me your problem. 

  > Concordia is closed because of Corona! 

  Please tell me more about Concordia!
