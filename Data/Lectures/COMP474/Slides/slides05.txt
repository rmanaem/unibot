open license 
 
Available as machine-readable structured data (e.g., 
excel instead of an image scan) 
 
As before, but using a non-proprietary format (e.g., 
CSV instead of excel) 
 
All the above, plus use open standards (RDF & Co.) to 
identify things, so that people could point at your stuff 
 
All the above, plus link your data to other people’s data 
to provide context

Linked Data: Design Issues

Origin
First proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 2006
https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html

What’s a “link”?
Technically, a link is a triple where

• the subject IRI is in one graph (namespace) and
• the predicate and/or object are in a different graph (namespace)

Types of Links

Identity Link: points to the same object or concept in another knowledge graph
(e.g., Canada in DBpedia and Wikidata)

Relationship Link: points to other objects related to a given one (e.g., from a person
to the city they live in)

Vocabulary Link: between data and their vocabulary term
(e.g., IRI is a foaf:Person) or between vocabulary terms
(e.g., ex:Student rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person)

Creating Links

Instance Level
Creating links on the instance level (IRIs):
owl:sameAs Most widely used, but makes strong assumptions about both IRIs

being identical (it is symmetric and transitive)
rdfs:seeAlso Just a reference, makes no claim about the IRIs being identical

(no specific semantics)
using vocabularies e.g., skos:exactMatch, foaf:knows

Schema Level
Two graphs can also be linked on the schema level:

• Using owl:equivalentClass and owl:equivalentProperty
• Using rdfs:subClassOf and rdfs:subPropertyOf
• Using vocabularies, e.g., skos:broadMatch or skos:narrowMatch

Linked Data: Design Issues II

The “four rules”

1 Use URIs as names for things.
2 Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
3 When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards

(RDF, SPARQL).
4 Include links to other URIs, so that they can discover more things.

Major Points
To create a knowledge base in
LOD-compliant format:

1 Make your data “5-star”
2 Create URIs following the

guidelines
3 Select appropriate

vocabularies
4 Extend existing vocabularies

if necessary
5 Link your data to other

knowledge graphs
6 Publish your knowledge

graph on the web

Competency Questions

Knowledge Base Design
Unlike (relational) databases, knowledge bases do not have a rigid, pre-defined
design for a specific application

• Encourage inter-connection of knowledge
• Still helpful to have an idea of possible use cases

Design Method

• Start with a set of questions to guide the design of the vocabulary and data
triples

• It must be possible to answer the questions when the knowledge base has
been constructed

• These competency questions can be seen as a requirements specification for a
vocabulary or knowledge base

Competency Questions: Examples

Examples
Some possible competency questions for a university knowledge graph:
Q1: Which courses are offered at University X?
Q2: Which topics are covered by a course C?
Q3: Which professors teach at university X?
Q4: What are the prerequisites for a given course C?
Q5: Which universities offer courses that cover topic T ?

Note
These mostly follow a single pattern

Which [CE1] [OPE] [CE2]?

DBpedia Spotlight: Disambiguation

Approach
Spotlight uses a statistical model for disambiguation

• Using the context of a word/phrase
• Learned from the Wikipedia pages including the links (for multiple languages)

A 2012 paper reports a 85.1% accuracy for English (with 7.4% missing links)

Discussion

• Modern approaches for disambiguation use word embeddings (discussed later
in the course), with better performance

• However, Spotlight is a stable, easy-to-install tool and useful for first
experiments

Facebook’s Open Graph Protocol

Idea

• Turn web page into graph object
• Provide rich information when pages are “shared”
• Similar idea to schema.org, except now

Facebook is the consumer (instead of search
engines)

• Vocabulary at http://ogp.me/ns#

Used together with the “Like” button

• When clicked, Facebook creates a connection in its graph between the page
and the user

• If the user was logged in, add information to user’s profile

Facebook Graph Search

• Facebook provided public graph search functionality from 2013–2019
• These have been largely removed, most likely due to privacy concerns
