Summary I

“Data is the new oil”

Organizations have invaluable knowledge “hidden” in documents:
• Products, inventions, solutions, techniques, experiences, insights, . . .

NLP/Text Mining can unlock this knowledge

What do you need?

• Need business vision to drive adoption
• Technology is mature and foundations are open source

E.g., IBM’s UIMA or University of Sheffield’s GATE

Risks

• Increasing legal and ethical concerns
E.g., Ethical AI, Responsible AI, Explainable AI

Overcoming Information Silos

• Knowledge Graphs can integrate different sources within an organization
(full text, databases, spreadsheets, etc.)

• Automatically manage an organization’s knowledge;
discover novel insights by combining multiple sources

• External Knowledge Bases to further enrich the data

What do you need?

• State-of-the-art technology: graph databases, triple stores, reasoning engines,
etc.

• Reasonably mature technology (open source & commercial), many SAAS
vendors

Brief History of Chatbots

Turing Test: “A truly intelligent machine would be
indistinguishable from a human” (A. Turing, 1950)

Early chatbots were developed by scientists:

• MIT Eliza (1966), the psychotherapist bot

• Stanford Parry (1972), the schizophrenic patient

• A.L.I.C.E (1995), the companion AI

Eliza (1966)

How does Eliza work?

See Weizenbaum’s paper at:
http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/331/papers/eliza.html

“Input sentences are analyzed on the basis of decomposition rules which
are triggered by key words appearing in the input text. Responses are
generated by reassembly rules associated with selected decomposition
rules.”

Eliza Example

Eliza + DOCTOR script

If the input sentence is:
I am very unhappy these days.

Eliza’s response will be:
How long have you been very unhappy these days?

Processing

Keyword:
I am

Decomposition pattern:
I am <whatever>

Reassembly Pattern:
How long have you been <whatever>?

Chatbots: The Business Case

What do you need?

• Specify the business case
• Define concrete use cases
• Determine KPIs and evaluate
• Re-envision Risk Management

• Select a vendor or develop in-house
• Be aware of the bot lifecycle

Summary

• “Hot” business topic, emerging after decades of research
• Huge difference in scope (simple rules vs. sophisticated reasoning)
• Again, new legal and ethical issues

E.g., bots pretending to be human, political campaigning, medical advice
