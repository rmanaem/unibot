Introduction

SPARQL W3C Standard
SPARQL stands for. . .

“SPARQL Protocol And RDF
Query Language”

• Current version 1.1 (like RDF, RDFS,
etc.)

• Language for querying graphs
• and a protocol for doing this over the

web using a SPARQL endpoint
• Major difference between 1.0 and

1.1: modifying graphs via SPARQL
(insert, delete etc.)

Describing a resource
Simple query that can be used when no information about a graph’s content is
available.

Example 1
DESCRIBE <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concordia_University>

Example 2

PREFIX geo: <http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
DESCRIBE ?s
WHERE { ?s geo:lat "45.497002"^^xsd:float .

?s geo:long "-73.578003"^^xsd:float . }

Selecting triples from a graph

Probably the most widely used type of SPARQL query

• Select triples from a graph that match a given triple pattern
• Like an RDF triple, except subject, predicate, and/or object may be a variable

Select: some details

DISTINCT
Use SELECT DISTINCT to remove redundant triples

ORDER BY
Use ORDER BY to sort the result triples (e.g., ORDER BY ?amount)

LIMIT
Use LIMIT to restrict the number of results (e.g., LIMIT 10)

Functions
You can use functions like AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT(), SUM(), e.g.,

SELECT (MAX(?amount) as ?maxAmount)
WHERE { ?meal e:amount ?amount . }

Optional Information
Use the OPTIONAL keyword to match optional information, e.g.,

prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

select ?name ?url
where {

?person foaf:name ?name .
OPTIONAL { ?person rdfs:seeAlso ?url }

}

• This will return a person’s URL, if there is one
• Without the OPTIONAL, persons without URLs would not have been matched

Filter

Filtering Information
Use a FILTER to remove results that were matched by WHERE, e.g.:

PREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?comment
WHERE {

dbr:Linked_data rdfs:comment ?comment .
FILTER (lang(?comment) = "en")

}

• Here, we restrict all matched abstracts to those with an English language tag.
• FILTERs can operate on numbers, strings, dates, URIs, or other data types

and support regular expressions.
