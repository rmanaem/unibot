COMP 474/6741 Intelligent Systems (Winter 2022) Worksheet #7: Intelligent Agents Task 1. What kind of question would you expect a Concordia Chatbot to be able to handle? 1. For new students (not currently registered at Concordia): • • • 2. For current students (already enrolled at Concordia): • • • Task 2. Write a regular expression that matches diﬀerent variations of naming https://www.wikidata. org/wiki/Q326342: “Concordia”, “Concordia U.”, “CU”, “Concordia University”, “Universit´e Concor- dia”, . . . : Test it at https://regex101.com/ Task 3. Suppose we want to use an existing set of 1000 questions for training a ML classiﬁer. If we use tf-idf vectors to represent each question, how many dimensions will the vectors have (make a rough estimate)? Task 4. Ok, here is an (extremely simpliﬁed) idea of creating 2D feature vectors out of a natural language question: The ﬁrst dimension a encodes the ﬁrst occurrence of a question word (see table below) and the second dimension b the number of Capital Letters in the sentence: Contains? Value # Question a b Class Who 1 1 Where is Concordia? Location What 2 2 Who was Steve Jobs? Deﬁnition Where 3 3 What city is McGill in? Location (none) 0 4 What is NLP? Deﬁnition (cid:207) Task 5. Using the online parser at https://corenlp.run/, create a parse tree for the sentence What is McGill?. Note that you can now extract the subject of the sentence, e.g., to plug it into a SPARQL query. BreakPage COMP 474/6741 Worksheet: Intelligent Agents Winter 2022 (cid:207) Task 6. Now deﬁne a SPARQL template that can obtain information about a person from DBpedia. To keep it simple, assume that the name extracted via NLP from the question is the identical to the full name stored in the (English) label ﬁeld for the subject (e.g., “Steve Jobs”). PREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> SELECT . . . WHERE { . . . } Task 7. Now apply the kNN classiﬁcation algorithm on the new question below to classify its type, according to the training data from Task 4. Use k = 3 and the Euclidian distance d(p(cid:126), (cid:126)q) = (cid:112)(cid:80)n (p − q )2: i=1 i i # Question a b d-Q1 d-Q2 d-Q3 d-Q4 Class? 5 What is McGill? You can now match the new question with a corresponding SPARQL template to obtain a query for your knowledge graph, ﬁlling in variables with the values extracted from the question. Task 8. For the questions in Task 1 above, which of the chatbot techniques covered so far would be able to answer them? 1. Q1a: 2. Q1b: 3. Q1c: 4. Q2a: 5. Q2b: 6. Q2c: BreakPage
