Worksheet #7: Intelligent Agents

Task 1. What kind of question would you expect a Concordia Chatbot to be able to handle?

1. For new students (not currently registered at Concordia):

•

•

•

2. For current students (already enrolled at Concordia):

•

•

•

Task 2. Write a regular expression that matches different variations of naming https://www.wikidata.
org/wiki/Q326342: “Concordia”, “Concordia U.”, “CU”, “Concordia University”, “Université Concor-
dia”, . . . :

Task 3. Suppose we want to use an existing set of 1000 questions for training a ML classifier. If we
use tf-idf vectors to represent each question, how many dimensions will the vectors have (make a rough
estimate)?

Task 4. Ok, here is an (extremely simplified) idea of creating 2D feature vectors out of a natural
language question: The first dimension a encodes the first occurrence of a question word (see table
below) and the second dimension b the number of Capital Letters in the sentence:

Contains? Value

Who 1

What 2

Where 3

(none) 0

# Question a b Class

1 Where is Concordia? Location

2 Who was Steve Jobs? Definition

3 What city is McGill in? Location

4 What is NLP? Definition

Task 5. Using the online parser at https://corenlp.run/, create a parse tree for the sentence What isÏ
McGill?. Note that you can now extract the subject of the sentence, e.g., to plug it into a SPARQL
query.

Task 6. Now define a SPARQL template that can obtain information about a person from DBpedia.Ï
To keep it simple, assume that the name extracted via NLP from the question is the identical to the full
name stored in the (English) label field for the subject (e.g., “Steve Jobs”).

PREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>

SELECT . . .

WHERE {

. . .

}

Task 7. Now apply the kNN classification algorithm on the new question below to classify its
type, according to the training data from Task 4. Use k = 3 and the Euclidian distance d(~p, ~q) =√∑n

i=1(pi − qi)2:

# Question a b d-Q1 d-Q2 d-Q3 d-Q4 Class?

5 What is McGill?

You can now match the new question with a corresponding SPARQL template to obtain a query for
your knowledge graph, filling in variables with the values extracted from the question.

Task 8. For the questions in Task 1 above, which of the chatbot techniques covered so far would be
able to answer them?

1. Q1a:

2. Q1b:

3. Q1c:

4. Q2a:

5. Q2b:

6. Q2c:
