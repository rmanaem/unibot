Worksheet #2: Vocabularies & Ontologies

Task 1. Quick refresher: Using the N-Triples serialization format, write an RDF triple describingÏ
Concordia’s homepage:

Task 2. Define the fact that Student is a class (as opposed to an instance, like Jane). Use
Turtle format with the following prefix definitions and define Student as part of the ex namespace
(ex:Student):

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .

@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

Add the triple:

and draw the resulting graph:

Task 3. Now add another triple stating that Jane (ex:jane#me) is of type ex:Student:

and add it to the graph above.

Task 4. It is good practice to give every IRI a human-readable label (where appropriate). Add two
rdfs:label triples (in English and French) for “Student”:

1.

2.

(Similarly, you would define an rdfs:comment to explain what it means to be a student.)

Task 5. For now at least, every Student is a Person (sorry, robots!). Define this fact as a triple (use
foaf:Person) and add it to your graph above:

Task 6. Ok, let’s look at these three triples (written in pseudocode for brevity):

<LS-210> <teaches> <COMP472/6721> .

<professor> <is a> <slide> .

<student> <handed in by> <assignment> .

Are these syntactically legal triples? (Spoiler alert: yes, we could write each of them using perfectly fine
RDF URIs.) So what exactly is wrong here?

Task 7. We now define a property, studiesAt, so that we can indicate at which university a student is
studying. Write the triple defining studiesAt as a property (again using the ex: namespace):

(Note: properties should also have labels & comments, but we omit this here.)

Task 8. We now have to add domain and range restrictions for our property to avoid problems like the
ones in Task 6 above. For the domain of our studiesAt property, we only permit ex:Student resources
and for the range, we only admit ex:University resources. Write the two triples:

1.

2.

Task 9. A widely used vocabulary for describing people and their (social) networks is Friend-of-a-FriendÏ
(FOAF), which you’ve seen before:

PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

1. Assume Joe has a photo of him published under http://facebook.me/joe.png (not a real URL).
How can you add this information to the knowledge graph using FOAF (hint: look up the vocabu-
lary using the prefix URL above):

2. Again using FOAF, model that Jane is 22 years old:
