COMP 474/6741 Intelligent Systems (Winter 2022) Worksheet #4: Knowledge Base Design & Applications Task 1. Quick refresher: How do you select all triples in a graph using SPARQL? SELECT . . . WHERE { . . . } Task 2. Now for something slightly diﬀerent: Can you write a SPARQL query that selects all the properties that were declared in a graph? PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> SELECT DISTINCT ?property WHERE { . . . } This is an example for a query that’s useful during knowledge base development, to show or test the metadata of a graph. (cid:207) Task 3. Find the URI for Meat Loaf (the musician, not the dish) in both DBpedia and Wikidata. What’s a major diﬀerence between the two graphs? And what is the technical reason for it? (cid:207) Task 4. Wikidata also has a public SPARQL query interface, located at https://query.wikidata.org/. You previously found the URI for Concordia in Wikidata. Now, try to write a SPARQL query that returns the city (URI, name) for Concordia from Wikidata: SELECT ?city ?cityname WHERE { . . . } BreakPage COMP 474/6741 Worksheet: Knowledge Base Design & Applications Winter 2022 Task 5. Create a competency question and a corresponding SPARQL query for our FOCU university example: Testing query: SELECT . . . WHERE { . . . } (cid:207) Task 6. An early, well-known commercial service for semantic annotation of textual (mostly news) documents was Thompson Reuter’s OpenCalais, which has since been spun out and re-branded as Reﬁnitif Intelligent Tagging: Try out the online demo at https://permid.org/onecalaisViewer on a document, for example the ﬁrst part of the Wikipedia article on Concordia. Look at the entities that were detected and go to the “RDF view”: what ID is given to Concordia in this knowledge graph? Hint: There is another tool at the top of the page, Entity Search, where you can cross-check your entities. (cid:207) Task 7. Go to the DBpedia Spotlight online demo at https://www.dbpedia-spotlight.org/demo/. Try analyzing a test document with some ambiguities, e.g, “Paris Hilton went to the Hilton in Paris.” Inspect the entities that were linked to DBpedia. Are they correct? (cid:207) Task 8. Using Google’s Structured Data Testing Tools,1 examine your favorite movie on IMDB.2 1. Find some vocabulary terms that are used to model the movie information: 2. Find the corresponding vocabulary deﬁnition URL online: (cid:207) Task 9. Find an article online, let’s say from the always trustworthy Mtl Blog.3 Look at the HTML source in your browser and ﬁnd the META tags. Identify entries used by Facebook’s Open Graph Protocol. Now try running the same article through W3C’s RDFa 1.1 Distiller and Parser at https://www.w3. org/2012/pyRdfa/. Choose Turtle format and compare the triples linking the article using Facebook’s OGP. 1https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool 2https://www.imdb.com 3https://www.mtlblog.com BreakPage
