COMP 474/6741 Intelligent Systems (Winter 2022) Worksheet #6: Introduction to Machine Learning k Task 1. A quick refresher: Based on the output below, compute precision@k = 1 · (cid:80) rel(c) for the three k c=1 recommender systems (for k = 1, 2, 3): System@k precision@k 1 2 3 1 2 3 system 1 (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:51) system 2 (cid:55) (cid:51) (cid:51) system 3 (cid:51) (cid:51) (cid:51) Task 2. Here is a dataset of documents with two attributes, to be grouped into two clusters. Apply k-Means clustering, by computing the Euclidian distance d(p(cid:126), (cid:126)q) = (cid:112)(cid:80)n (p − q )2 of each data point to i=1 i i the two initial centro¨ıds and assigning each document to its closest cluster: a1 a2 Distance to C1 Distance to C2 Cluster Tag Centro¨ıd Doc1 1.5 2.0 #Travel a1 a2 Doc2 3.0 4.0 #Food Cluster 1 1.0 1.0 Cluster 2 5.0 7.0 Doc3 4.5 5.0 #Travel Doc4 3.5 4.5 #Food (Ignore the “Tag” column for now, we’ll use it in the next question!) Task 3. Now apply the kNN classiﬁcation algorithm on the new document below to determine its tag. Use k = 3 and the Euclidian distance d(p(cid:126), (cid:126)q) = (cid:112)(cid:80)n (p − q )2 (just like for k-Means-clustering): i=1 i i a1 a2 d-Doc1 d-Doc2 d-Doc3 d-Doc4 Tag? Doc5 2.5 3.5 You can now auto-assign a tag to the new document based on a majority vote of the k nearest neighbors. BreakPage COMP 474/6741 Worksheet: Introduction to ML Winter 2022 Task 4. Should we invest $100m in producing this new movie? We’ll use machine learning to predict the rating (1–5 stars) of a movie, by applying the regression version of the kNN algorithm. Here’s our training data: # Movie Length #Zombies #Explosions Rating 1 Movie 1 135 0 5 (cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:70) 2 Movie 2 90 123 2 (cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:70) 3 Movie 3 159 2 1 (cid:70) 4 Movie 4 109 5 3 To ﬁnd the predicted rating for Movie #4, ﬁrst ﬁnd the two nearest neighbors (i.e., k = 2), using the same calculation as before: d(m(cid:126) , m(cid:126) ) = d(m(cid:126) , m(cid:126) ) = d(m(cid:126) , m(cid:126) ) = =⇒ Closest = , 4 1 4 2 4 3 Now, compute the average of the ratings of the k nearest movies for k = 2 (convert the (cid:63) rating into a value in [1...5]): This is your predicted rating for Movie 4! Task 5. Here are three diﬀerent systems that classiﬁed 500 data items: Last time, we already calculated Precision and Recall for these systes (you can verify that the alternative formulas here give you the same results). Now, compute the Accuracy and F -Measure: 1 TP + TN system 1 system 2 system 3 Accuracy = P + N Precision n/a 1.0 0.71 TP Recall = TP + FN Recall 0 0.6 1.0 TP Precision = Accuracy TP + FP 2 · Precision · Recall F -Measure F = 1 1 Precision + Recall BreakPage
